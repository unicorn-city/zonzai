      This is Conway's game of life, cells can be placed with the mouse. I'll
      next add a menu of pre-made patterns that can be placed.

      There was a tree simulator here, but I removed it in the transition to a
      cellular automata approach. Simulating plants is very difficult, yet I
      just had the idea of a CA where cells store resources (like water) and
      transfer them out to neighbors with osmosis. If a cell has an abundance of
      nutrients it could grow a neighbor and if it has a derth it will die.
      Still need to figure out how to model light and branching.
